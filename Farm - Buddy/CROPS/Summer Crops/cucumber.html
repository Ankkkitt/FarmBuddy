        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">The botanical name of cucumber is Cucumis sativus. Cucumbers are originated in India.
                It is a climbing plant which is used as summer vegetable throughout in India. The cucumber fruit is
                eaten raw or is served as a salad or cooked as a vegetable. The seeds of cucumber are used for oil
                extraction which is good for body and brain. Cucumbers contain 96% water which is good in summer season.
                The plants are large sized, leaves are hairy and are triangular in shape and flowers are yellow in
                color. Cucumber is an excellent source of Mb (Molybdenum) and Vitamin K. Cucumber is used to cure skin
                problems, kidney and heart problems and is used as alkalizer.<br>

        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">﻿It can be sown in variety of soils ranging from sandy loam to heavy soil. But a loamy
                soil which is rich in organic matter and has well drainage system is best for the cucumber farming. The
                pH ranging from 6-7 is suited best for cucumber farming.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Land Preparations </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text"> For cucumber plantation, it requires well prepared and weed free field. To bring soil
                to fine tilth, 3-4 ploughings must be done before planting. FYM such as cow dung is mixed with soil to
                enrich the field. Then nursery beds are prepared having width of 2.5m and at the distance of 60cm.<br>

            <p class="card-text">
                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Time of sowing</span><br>
                It is sown in the month of February-March.
                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">spacing</span><br>
                Sow two seeds per place of bed which is 2.5m wide and use spacing of 60cm between seeds.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Sowing Depth</span><br>
                Seeds are sown at the depth of 2-3cm.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Method of Sowing</span><br>
                Low tunnel technology: This technology is used to produce early yield of cucumber in early summer. It
                helps to protect the crop from cold season i.e. in the month of December and January. Beds of 2.5m width
                are sown in the month of December. Seeds are sown both sides of the bed at the distance of 45cm. Before
                sowing supportive rods of 45-60cm length are fixed in the soil. Cover the field with plastic sheet (100
                gauge thickness) with the help of support rods. Plastic sheet should be removed mainly in the month of
                February when temperature is suitable outside.
                <br>• Dibbling method<br>
                <br>• Basing method<br>
                <br>• Layout in ring method<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Irrigation </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">In summer season it requires frequent irrigation and in rainy season it does not
                require any irrigation. In total it requires 10-12 irrigations. Pre-irrigation is required before sowing
                then subsequent irrigation is required after 2-3 days of sowing. After second sowing, the crops are then
                irrigated at the interval of 4-5 days. Drip irrigation is very useful for this crop.<br>
