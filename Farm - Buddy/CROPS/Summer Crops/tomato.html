        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> General Introduction </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Tomato is originated in Peru of South America. It is important commercial vegetable
                crop of India. It is the second most important crop of world after potato. Fruits are eaten raw or in
                cooked form. It is rich source of vitamin A, C, potassium and minerals. It is used in soup, juice and
                ketch up, powder. The major tomato producing states are Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa,
                Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In Punjab state, Amritsar, Ropar,
                Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur are tomato growing districts.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Soil </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">It can be grown in varied type of soil ranging from sandy loam to clay, black soil and
                red soil having proper drainage. It gives best result when grown under well drained sandy soil with high
                organic content. For good growth pH of soil should be 7-8.5. It can tolerate moderate acidic and saline
                soil. Avoid cultivation in high acidic soils. For early crops, light soil is beneficial where for heavy
                yields clay loam and silt-loam soils are useful.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Land Preparations </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">For tomato plantation, it required well pulverise and levelled soil. To bring soil to
                fine tilth, plough land for 4-5times, then planking is done to make soil level. At time of last
                ploughing add well decomposed cow dung and Carbofuron@5kg or Neem cake@8kg per acre should be applied.
                Transplantation of tomato is done on raised bed. For that prepared raised bed of 80-90cm width. To
                destroy harmful soil borne pathogen, pest and organism, soil solarization is carried out. It can be done
                by using transparent plastic film as mulch. This sheet absorb radiation and thus increases soil
                temperature and kill pathogen.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title "> Sowing </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">
                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Time of sowing</span><br>
                For northern state, tomato cultivation for spring season is done in late November and transplanted in
                second fortnight of January. For autumn crop, sowing is done in July - August and transplanted in August
                - September. In hilly areas sowing is done in March- April and transplantation is done in April -May.
                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">spacing</span><br>
                Depending upon variety use and its growth habit, use spacing of 60x30cm or 75x60cm or 75x75cm. In
                Punjab, for dwarf variety use spacing of 75cm x 30cm and for rainy season use spacing of 120-150 x 30cm.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Sowing Depth</span><br>
                In nursery sow seeds at depth of 4cm and then covered with soil.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Method of Sowing</span><br>
                Transplanting of seedling in main field.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Irrigation </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">In winter, apply irrigation with interval of 6 to 7days and in summer month, apply with
                interval of 10-15days depending upon soil moisture. Period of drought follow by heavy watering leads to
                cracking of fruits. Flowering stage is critical for irrigation, water stress during this stage can leads
                to flower drop and adversely affecting fruiting and productivity. According to various researches, it is
                found that, half inch irrigation at every fortnight causes maximum penetration of roots and thus gives
                high yield.<br>
