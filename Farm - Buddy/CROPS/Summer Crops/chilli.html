        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> General Introduction </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">It is known as the most valuable crop of India. It is used as a principle ingredient of
                various curries and chutneys, also used in vegetables, spices, condiments, sauces and pickles. Pungency
                in chillies is due to the active constituent "Capsaicin", an alkaloid. The native home of chilli is
                considered to be Mexico with secondary origin of Guatemala. Chilli was introduced in India by the
                Portuguese in Goa in the middle of 17th century and since then it had rapidly spread throughout the
                country. Capsaicin has many medicinal properties, especially as an anti-cancerous agent and instant pain
                reliever. It also prevents heart diseases by dilating blood vessels. Major chilli growing countries are
                India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Sri Lanka in Asia; Nigeria, Ghana, Tunisia and
                Egypt in Africa; Mexico, United States of America in North & Central America; Yugoslavia, Spain,
                Romania, Bulgaria, Italy and Hungary in Europe and Argentina, Peru and Brazil in South America. India is
                the world leader in chilli production followed by China & Pakistan. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,
                Karnataka, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, UP and Rajasthan are the main chilly growing states<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Soil </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Chilli is grown in many types of soils-sandy to heavy clay. A well-drained, fairly
                light fertile loam with a fair moisture holding capacity is ideal. The light soils produce better
                quality fruits than heavy soils. Chilli crop prefers a soil reaction ranging from pH 6â€“7.<br>

                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Time of sowing</span><br>
                The ideal time for raising nursery is from October end to mid of November. Cover the nursery area with
                50 % shade net and cover the sides using 40 / 50 mesh insect proof nylon net. Seedlings are ready for
                transplantation in 30-40 days (Usually in February - March)
                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">spacing</span><br>
                Use row to row spacing of 75 cm and plant to plant spacing of 45 cm.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Sowing Depth</span><br>
                In nursery sow seeds at depth of 4cm and then covered with soil.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Method of Sowing</span><br>
                Transplantation method is used.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Irrigation </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">It cant withstand heavy moisture so apply irrigation only when needed. Heavy irrigation
                causes lanky vegetative growth and flower drop. Number of irrigation and interval of irrigation depend
                on soil and climatic condition. If plant show dropping at 4 pm, it is indication of plant needed
                irrigation. Flowering and fruit development are most critical stages of water requirement. Stagnation of
                water should not be allowed in nursery and field as it causes fungal infection.<br>
