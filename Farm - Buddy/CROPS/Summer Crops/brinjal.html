        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Brinjal (Solenum melongena) belongs to family Solanaceae, considered native to India
                and is a widely grown vegetable in Asian countries. Also popular in other countries like Egypt, France,
                Italy and United States. Brinjal is a hardy crop than other vegetables. Due to its hardness, it can be
                successfully grown in dry area with low irrigation facilities. It is moderate source of Vitamins and
                minerals. It can grow throughout the year. India is second largest producer of Brinjal after China. In
                India major brinjal growing states are West Bengal, Orissa, Karnataka, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar
                Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Soil </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Brinjal is a hardy crop so it can be grown on different type of soils. As it is a long
                duration crop, it requires well drained fertile sandy loam soil which is best suited for its cultivation
                and gives good yield. For early crop light soil are good and for high yield clay loam, silt loam are
                suitable. For good growth pH of soil should be 5.5 to 6.6.<br>

            <p class="card-text">
                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Seed Rate</span><br>
                Use seed rate of 300-400 gm for preparing seedling for one acre land sowing.<br>
                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Seed Treatment</span><br>
                For sowing use only Trusted and good seeds. Before sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm or
                Carbendazim@3gm/kg of seeds. After chemical treatment, treat seeds with Trichoderma viride@4gm/kg of
                seed, dry in shed and sow immediately.

                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Time of sowing</span><br>
                For first crop, prepare nursery in October and seedlings are ready for transplantation in November.
                Second crop, prepare nursery in November and transplantation in first fortnight of February.
                Third crop, sow nursery in February-March and transplantation before end of April.
                Fourth crop, sow nursery in July and transplantation in August.
                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">spacing</span><br>
                The spacing generally depends on the variety (size and spread and bearing period) soil fertility. Use
                row to row spacing of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 35-40 cm.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Sowing Depth</span><br>
                In nursery sow seeds at depth of 1 cm and then covered with soil.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Method of Sowing</span><br>
                Transplantation of seedling in main field.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Irrigation </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Irrigate the field after every third or fourth day during the summer season and after
                12 to 15 days during the winter season. Timely irrigation is very important for high yields of brinjal.
                Brinjal fields should be regularly irrigated to keep the soil moist during frosty days. Avoid water
                stagnation in field as brinjal cannot tolerate water logging.<br>
