        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Groundnut is a significant oilseed, ideal for cultivation in tropic regions of the
                country. Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), is a species in the legume or "bean" family. It is considered to
                be local in South America. These are known by many other local names such as earthnuts, ground nuts,
                goober peas, monkey nuts, pygmy nuts and peanuts. Despite its name and appearance, the peanut is not a
                nut, but rather a legume.
                <br>
                Groundnut is the third most important oilseed of world. In India, it is available throughout the year.
                It is important source of protein grown mostly under rain-fed conditions. In India, Uttar Pradesh,
                Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major
                groundnut growing states.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Soil </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Groundnut is raised in a sandy loam as well as well drained sandy clay loam soil. Deep
                well- drained soil with pH of 6.5 -7 as well as having great fertility are perfect for groundnut
                cultivation. Spanish as well as Runner varieties are beneficial for good quality soil compared to the
                Virginia forms. The lack of pods is often rich in heavier grounds. An excellent climatic condition for
                better germination of groundnut is 31° C. Heavy and stiff clays are unsuitable for groundnut cultivation
                as the pod development is hampered in these soils.<br>

            <p class="card-text">
                <span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Time of sowing</span><br>
                Sow the rainfed crop with the advent of monsoon in the last week of June or in the Ist week of July.
                Complete sowing as early as possible as delay sowing results in reduction in yield. Where irrigation
                facility is available sow kharif groundnut from April end to May end.
                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">spacing</span><br>
                Spacing to be adopted is depends upon type of variety. i.e., for semi spreading variety (M 522) use
                spacing of 30cm between the rows and 22.5 cm between plants and for bunchy type varieties (SG 99, SG84)
                use spacing of 30x15 cm.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Sowing Depth</span><br>
                Healthy and well developed pods should be hand shelled with a suitable groundnut sheer about fornight
                before sowing. Pods are sown with help of seed drill at depth of 8-10 cm at a seed rate of 38-40
                kg/acre.

                <br><span class="badge badge-light text-dark">Method of Sowing</span><br>
                seeds are sown with help of seed drill.<br>

                can be taken up successfully where irrigation facilities exist. Avoid sowing groundnut in the same field
                year after year, as this practice results in heavy build- up of soil-borne diseases.<br>

        <h5 class="card-header experience_title"> Irrigation </h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Irrigation for two or three time depending upon seasonal rainfall is necessary for good
                crop growth. Apply first irrigation at flowering stage. If the Kharif crop is caught in a long spell of
                draught, especially at the pod formation stage, supplemental irrigation is given, if water is available
                (In pod development stage, 2 - 3 irrigations are given depending on the soil type). Another irrigation a
                few days before the harvest may be given for full recovery for pods from soil.<br>
